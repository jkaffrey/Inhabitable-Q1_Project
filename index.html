    <p>Thanks for coming to play!</p>
    <p>So what is this game you ask? Well it is a surval based game with the primary focus
    on collecting resource. The goal is to make money and to build at least one of each struct.
    You lose when your money goes into the negative so be careful!</p>
    <p>A few rules, when you build something that collects resoures such as a lumber mill or water pump
    it must be built directly next to what it collects from. If this is not done, it will not run or collect
    resources for you, it will however keep taking money as an upkeep cost.</p>
